		 <li>  Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot </li>
<p>A: Jitter plot is dot plot where every point is shifted by a small random amount from its original position (jittering),  
	which solves the problem when certain tenure occurs more than once in the data set  and the corresponding data points 
	fall right on top of each other, which makes it impossible to distinguish between them. 
	</p>

     <li> Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. 
	     (I'm going to skip saying "in your own words" going forward,
	     but I hope you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).</li>
<p>A: Histogram with the same bin width can look quite different based on the anchor point of the first bin.</p>

  <li> The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms)\
	  .And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage.
	  I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading?</li>
<p>A: In cases we choose incorrect bandwidth. If we choose too wide bandwidth 
	  we lose details and information and it can mislead observer that there were data in 
	places where should be gap.<p>

  <li> I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes 
	  "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms or KDEs". What does he mean by that?<li>
<p>A: You need to understand theory behind CDF to understand 
	  and interpret what CDF is showing. 
	  However once you understand CDF than it allow you to interpret with easy what fraction of points falls between 
	 any two values and help us understand how imbalanced a distribution is. </p>

<li>   What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for?</li>
<p>A: It is basically CDF with switched x and y axes. </p>
    <li>   How is a Probability plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</li>
 <p>A: A probability plot that we know that mostly as Q-Q plot and P-P plot is a graphical technique for comparing two data sets. It can be either two sets of empirical observations and one empirical set against other theoretical set. 
For several competing distributions to see which provides the best fit , we can generate probability plot and it is the best choice for generating the highest correlation coefficient since it generates the straightest probability plot.
The probability plot is useful for:
	 <ul>
  <li>   It provides a good fit to the data in a given distribution, such as the Weibull.</li>
   <li>   It helps us to know what distribution best fits the data.</li>
    <li>    We can see what are good estimates for the location and scale parameters of the chosen distribution.</li>
<ul>
 We have seen probability plots in advanced Machine Learning and Non linear Signal Processing </p>
    <li>   One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, 
	   median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - 
	   and why visualization of the full data is always better.</li>
A: These summary statistics apply only under certain assumptions and are misleading. Mean, median, and related summary statistics apply only to distribution with single central peak, if this assumption is not fulfilled the summary statistic will be wrong. Such things as outliers can significantly shift with mean and variance. The visualisation allow us to easily spot clusters and outliers.

    <li>    I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</li>
A: They combine lot of information in single graph. Box plots allow us to see if distribution is symmetric, how the weight is distributed between central peak and tails and outliers are not dropped. Most useful are when comparing several distributions against each other. 

    <li>    The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</li>
A: They are more informative than a plain box plot. They are useful when data have more than one peak (multimodal distribution). In this case a violin plot clearly shows the presence of different peaks, their position and relative amplitude. Disadvantage of violin plots is that they are less popular, their meaning can be harder to grasp for many readers not familiar with the violin plot representation.

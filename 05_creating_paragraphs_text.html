		 <l1>  Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot </li1>
<p>A: Jitter plot is dot plot where every point is shifted by a small random amount from its original position (jittering),  
	which solves the problem when certain tenure occurs more than once in the data set  and the corresponding data points 
	fall right on top of each other, which makes it impossible to distinguish between them. 
	</p>

     <li2> Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. 
	     (I'm going to skip saying "in your own words" going forward,
	     but I hope you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).</li2>
<p>A: Histogram with the same bin width can look quite different based on the anchor point of the first bin.</p>

  <li3> The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms)\
	  .And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage.
	  I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading?</li3>
<p>A: In cases we choose incorrect bandwidth. If we choose too wide bandwidth 
	  we lose details and information and it can mislead observer that there were data in 
	places where should be gap.<p>

  <li4> I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes 
	  "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms or KDEs". What does he mean by that?<li4>
<p>A: You need to understand theory behind CDF to understand 
	  and interpret what CDF is showing. 
	  However once you understand CDF than it allow you to interpret with easy what fraction of points falls between 
	
	 any two values and help us understand how imbalanced a distribution is.</h3> </li4>
